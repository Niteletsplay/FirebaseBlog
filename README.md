## Deployment

To start using this project, you only have to go into the .js files and
paste your firebase config like here:

```js
  var firebaseConfig = {
    // Put your firebase config here

    apiKey: "",
    authDomain: "",
    databaseURL: "",
    projectId: "",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: "",
    appId: ""
  };
```

Afterwards, you are already good to go!

Use signup.html to create an account / login.html to log into the account.

If you are already logged in, you will be automatically redirected to post_ui.html.
There you can write a blog-post and it will be displayed on the index.html.

Thats it!
